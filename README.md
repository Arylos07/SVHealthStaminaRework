# SVHealthStaminaRework
Rework of health and stamina systems in Stardew Valley; adding regen, scaling, and more.

# Outline
Outline of plans before my squirrel brain forgets them.

- Regen Health and Stamina over time
- Increase regen when sitting
- Regen on cooldown after taking damage/using stamina
- Remove watering can stamina usage
- Add scaling by making a skill that gains experience over time. As it levels up, stamina max increases
    - Should this increase by level or increased by Experience? Level makes it drastic while experience makes it subtle.
    - I could make two modes configurable by users but that seems like extra work.
